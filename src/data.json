Supporting this pattern required React to have a concept of an indeterminate component so that when a component first renders it can turn into either a ClassComponent or a FunctionComponent depending on what it returns. While this feature was deprecated and put behind a flag it is still in stable. This change remvoes the flag, removes the warnings, and removes the concept of IndeterminateComponent from the React codebase.\r\n\r\nWhile removing IndeterminateComponent type Seb and I discovered that we needed a concept of IncompleteFunctionComponent to support Suspense in legacy mode. This new work tag is only needed as long as legacy mode is around and ideally any code that considers this tag will be excludable from OSS builds once we land extra gates using `disableLegacyMode` flag.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI have encountered an issue where a class componentDidMount method is called before a ref is set in another. Also I am seeing sometimes it is being called twice, but not always. The ref is set in a class called Ex1 and the componentDidMount in a class called Ex2. There is also a forwardRef function component in the mix.\r\n\r\nReact version: 18.2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run \"npx create-react-app my-app\"\r\n2. Copy the code I have provided into app.js\r\n3. Run 'npm start'\r\n4. Open the dev tools and reload the page and follow the debugger points.\r\n\r\nHere is a fiddle with the issue. Please note that I was having issues with jsFiffle.net not fully loading. I don't think it was my fiddle, but it was acting weird. If that happens just create your own fiddle from scratch and it should work.\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/CodeMedic42/d50mnjz8/4/\r\n\r\nHere is a copy of my code\r\n```\r\nimport React, { useRef, Component, forwardRef } from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass Ex1 extends Component {\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\tconst {\r\n\t\t\tinnerRef,\r\n\t\t\tchildren,\r\n\t\t} = this.props;\r\n\r\n\t\treturn (\r\n\t\t\t<div\r\n\t\t\t\tref={(element) => {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconsole.log('This line is called after the componentDidMount in Ex2.');\r\n\t\t\t\t\tinnerRef.current = element;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdebugger;\r\n\t\t\t\t}}\r\n\t\t\t\tclassName=\"ex1\"\r\n\t\t\t>\r\n\t\t\t\t{children}\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Ex2 extends Component {\r\n\tcomponentDidMount() {\r\n\t\tconst { targetRef } = this.props;\r\n\r\n\t\tconsole.log('This line is hit before targetRef is set.');\r\n        console.log('Also it appears to be called twice. Once before the ref is set and once after.');\r\n\r\n\t\tdebugger;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\tconst {\r\n\t\t\tinnerRef,\r\n\t\t} = this.props;\r\n\r\n\t\treturn <div className=\"ex2\">I do my own thing</div>;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Bar1 = forwardRef((props, ref) => {\r\n\tconst {\r\n\t\tchildren,\r\n\t} = props;\r\n\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<Ex1 innerRef={ref}>\r\n\t\t\t{children}\r\n\t\t</Ex1>\r\n\t);\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction Test() {\r\n\tconst targetRef = useRef();\r\n\r\n\treturn (\r\n\t\t<Bar1 ref={targetRef}>\r\n\t\t\t<Ex2 targetRef={targetRef}/>\r\n\t\t</Bar1>\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Test;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nThe componentDidMount method in Ex2 is called before, and sometimes after, the call to the ref function in Ex1.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nThe componentDidMount method in Ex2 should be called once and after the ref is set in Ex1.\r\n",

Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nThis example contains a script where the server takes six seconds to respond. It changes the text `Slow script not loaded…` to `Slow script loaded!` once executed.\r\n\r\nNote that it immediately displays `Script suspense done!`.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect it to display the `Suspended for script…` Suspense fallback message for six seconds before switching to `Script suspense done!` around the same time that the `Slow script loaded!` switch is made.",

Open the address attached below in the mobile iOS environment\r\n2. Touch the red and green boxes quickly and repeatedly\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React.

Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nI think the issue reported here(#22521) is still happening. If you click the red and green boxes listed vertically and quickly, the green box's onClick event is ignored and the red onClick event is called twice. However, using the onTouchEnd event instead of the onClick event does not cause any problems.\r\n\r\nAs reported in the issue(#22521), the onClick event works normally in the vanilla js environment.\r\nThank you for taking a look :)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/assets/26402298/29310705-66db-419a-91f8-0001a8132567\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe onClick event of an element clicked by the user must be called correctly. Thank you!",

Obviously not everything could be \"universal\" so there are a couple of caveats which require conditional passing of props from one component to another based on their environments (e.g. server comp passing something to a client component).\r\n\r\nCurrently, this was done on my side by checking if the target component is either of type `object` or `function` since nextjs's implementation wraps references in a `Proxy` wrapper. However other frameworks like [`waku`](https://waku.gg/) have different mechanisms to handle server/client references, thus I opted into searching a more \"stable\" solution through `react-is`.\r\n\r\nSymbols for `react.client.reference` and `react.server.reference` already exists in the codebase but are not exposed. Given the scenario above I believe it would be more convenient for library author to utilize the `react-is` package for such cases.\r\n\r\nIf there is an initial feedback if this is might be even be considered as an option, I will proceed with exposing the `server` symbol. Also I suspect this exact symbols should be tested through ReactFlight but I'm still getting familiar with the codebase. \r\n",

Still, some APIs exist that conceptionally \"consume\" the ref since they bind the ref to a value. This includes `forwardRef` that already implemented filtering the `ref` prop out to the props passed to the inner component. We also need to do the same for class components. A `ref` passed a class component is bound to that class instance, if we keep the ref unfiltered and the component spreads all the props to a child component the `ref` would see 2 or more values set to it.\n",

This holds for currently released React versions.\r\nAs a follow-up, we introduce a separate field that holds the list of possible wrappers we try to match against e.g. for `useFormStatus` -> `dispatcher.useHostTransitionStatus` (see https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28413)\r\n\r\nOne downside is that sourcemaps are bugged in our Jest tests. See https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28413#discussion_r1513318378. I'm trying to find out what's up with that.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n- [x] react-debug-tools tests\r\n- [x] inspected components with hooks (e.g. `FunctionWithHooks`) in the shell (requires https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28596)\r\n- [x] Backwards compat with 16.8: https://8qq2sv.csb.app/\r\n- [x] Backwards compat with 17.0: https://g67r45.csb.app/\r\n- [x] Backwards compat with 18.0: https://ydjfsq.csb.app/\r\n- [x] Compat with Experimental: https://pk38dk.csb.app/\r\n",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThank you for featuring a few `flight` examples on the barebones of RSC! They have been tremendously helpful to me in understanding the model.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I find myself lost in them. I know it's not an issue per se but I'd be thankful if you consider this feedback and maybe even improve on the examples as the result of it. \r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nMy feedback comes down to a few random questions and a few fundamental questions to the RSC model and how to get the right image of it in my head. Please note I'm mainly focusing on understanding the _internals_ of RSC (ala I want to build an RSC rendering/serving pipeline from scratch). \r\n\r\n### Random questions\r\n\r\n#### 1. **Why do this request forwarding?**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/9c75cd5e84c4c524f42e65027cfd3dce746d6916/fixtures/flight-esm/server/global.js#L52-L61\r\n\r\nWhy not split endpoints and have them clear:\r\n- This returns the initial HTML;\r\n- This returns whichever Server Action data is passed to the server component. \r\n\r\nPutting it all in a single request handler makes the example significantly harder to grasp. I get it, these are not educational materials but a bit of documentation and structuring would go a long way. \r\n\r\n#### 2. **Why are \"global\" and \"region\" server implementations so dramatically different?**\r\n\r\nI thought those represented the target of your deployment but they straight changed the approach to rendering completely.\r\n\r\nThey also run in different contexts:\r\n- \"global\" runs with the \"--condition react-server\" condition.\r\n- \"region\" does not.\r\n\r\nI get it, they rely on different packages but I fail to see how those implementations co-exist (_do_ they co-exist? Is it like \"deploy region.js when building APP_1, and deploy global.js when building APP_2?). Are those two different ways to implement RSC or one inseparable whole split into two parts?\r\n\r\nThey have to because some actually render the HTML while others just return serialized components from the endpoints. How am I supposed to combine the two? Run two servers...?\r\n\r\n#### 3. How does this code compile?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/9c75cd5e84c4c524f42e65027cfd3dce746d6916/fixtures/flight-esm/src/index.js#L4\r\n\r\nThat package has no source on NPM. There's an issue open about it (#27197). An oversight? Would pretty much like to have an ESM version of the binding because others imply I'm using a compiler (webpack/turbopack), which I'm not.\r\n\r\nI think the ESM example is actually the one I'm the most interested in because it doesn't need a compiler. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Why does only the \"region\" server of the ESM example import the action?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/9c75cd5e84c4c524f42e65027cfd3dce746d6916/fixtures/flight-esm/server/region.js#L57\r\n\r\nIs this logic not applicable to other examples, like when using webpack or turobpack? Do the compilers extract and save the actions in the manifest json? A little bit of documentation on this would be fantastic (I will touch on it at the end).\r\n\r\n#### 5. How does this even run?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/9c75cd5e84c4c524f42e65027cfd3dce746d6916/fixtures/flight-browser/index.html#L23\r\n\r\nThe bundle it points to contains `__webpack_require__` expressions, which will fail in the browser:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.unpkg.com/react-server-dom-webpack@18.3.0-canary-a870b2d54-20240314/umd/react-server-dom-webpack-client.browser.development.js\r\n\r\nI feel like this index.html is missing some setup around and does not illustrate the example in isolation (relies on webpack anyway?).\r\n\r\n#### 6. Why do examples use babel?\r\n\r\nI suspect it's to transform JSX to `React.createElement()` calls but I'd love to read a bit more about _when_ that transformation happens. I see some examples use a custom `--loader` for Node.js. Is that related? Do you use that loader to pass imported things through Babel? \r\n\r\nThis may be the answer to the question I have regarding custom components as those will not render using `react-dom` or any other packages:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { renderToPipeableStream } from 'react-dom/server'\r\n\r\nfunction Button() {\r\n  return <button>Hi</button>\r\n}\r\n\r\nrenderToPipeableStream(React.createElement(Button.type, Button.props, Button.props.children))\r\n// Error!\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 7. Is there a place for a more developer-friendly API?\r\n\r\nImagine I want to build a tool on top of the RSC protocol. Do you really have to implement those server endpoints by myself? Analyze `text/x-component`, decode the Server Actions? What happens if React changes how those behave? This looks like it would benefit greatly from a higher-level public API. \r\n\r\n### Fundamental questions\r\n\r\n1. Can we please collaborate and come up with a series of diagrams that explain the underlying implementation of RSC _incrementally_? Things like: okay, there are 2/3/4 parts to an RSC:\r\n\r\n- Server part, where you have a `GET /` endpoint that takes a component and pipes its render stream to the response to return the initial, non-interactive HTML from the server.\r\n- Server part, were you also have a `GET /` for some reason but now it uses a different DOM binding that doesn't return an HTML but instead some serialized representation of the component tree (i.e. `0:[$, \"<button>\", ...]`). \r\n- Server part, where you have a `POST /` endpoint that resolves any Server Actions.\r\n- Some other part, that takes the serialized representation of the component tree, feeds it _another_ DOM binding to then hydrate the Root. \r\n\r\nThis would be gold. I'm convinced this will be useful to anybody getting to use RSC. Please, let's do this and not be shy on technical details (that's why I mentioned \"incrementally\" so anyone can drop off at the level they feel comfortable). \r\n\r\nI know @kentcdodds is working on the RSC workshop on EpicWeb.dev and I think he'd be over the moon to have a set of such diagrams to show to his students. I know they'd be tremendously helpful to me as I'm trying to wrap my head around testing all this. \r\n\r\n",

I suspect this is yet another Google Translate issue, but I can't find any posts about it so i wanted to report it.\r\n\r\nThis is a snippet from my Next.js 14 project, React 18.2.\r\n```\r\n\r\n<div className=\"md:col-span-4 lg:col-span-5\">\r\n                            <div className=\"mb-2\">\r\n                                <Link href=\"/\" className=\"block\">\r\n                                    <span className=\"flex text-xl font-light\">\r\n                                        <Image className=\"\" src={Logo1x} height={64} width={64} alt=\"Hero\" priority placeholder=\"blur\"/>\r\n                                        <div className=\"flex flex-col justify-center ml-5\">\r\n                                            <div className=\"flex text-xl font-light\">\r\n                                                <p className=\"font-poppins text-white\">My Text</p>\r\n                                                <p className=\"font-poppins text-vai-highlight\">My Text2</p>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                            <div className=\"text-sm text-gray-400  transition duration-150 ease-in-out\">More text here.</div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </span>\r\n                                </Link>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error when using Google Translate to Italian:\r\n```\r\napp-index.js:35 Warning: Prop `alt` did not match. Server: \"Eroe\" Client: \"Hero\"\r\napp-index.js:35 Warning: An error occurred during hydration. The server HTML was replaced with client content in <#document>.\r\nUncaught Error: Text content does not match server-rendered HTML.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe interesting part is that if i remove this snippet, i'll see the error pop up on another element - for example, if i remove the <Image> here, then it'll say the first inner-most <p> with 'My Text' changed.",
